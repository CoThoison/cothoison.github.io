        Women7 is an event that occurred at ENSEEIHT and the Cité de l’espace (Space city) for 2 days. 
        It is organized by people of ENSEEIHT (students, administration, …). 
        This event aims to draw the attention of the role of women in the field of engineering. 
        This gathers girls of around 14 years old to meet and discuss about the role of women in the field of engineering. <br/><br/>
        The first day takes place at ENSEEIHT and the second at the Cité de l’espace (Space city) where the girls can listen to conferences.
        This was my second work as a volunteer and it was a pleasure! I had the chance to be sectioned by the new president of Photo7 to cover the 2 days.<br/><br/> 
        The first day I had to cover few hours during the discussion between the girls and some people from engineering companies or research laboratory at ENSEEIHT.<br/><br/> 
        The second day I covered the whole day at the Cite de l’espace (Space city) during conferences and exhibition.
        I appreciate the president of Photo7 of choosing me to cover the 2 days of Women7 and to edit my own photos.
