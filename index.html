                <p>I spent many years on Minecraft. This game is very malleable. Thanks to "plugins" Minecraft can be changed, 
                    you can add, delete and modify aspects of the game. This is only possible with JAVA code (because Minecraft is programmed in JAVA). 
                    It is how I dive into the world of computer sciences.

                    (sciences de l'ingénieur) more than the nearest highschool (where I was supposed to go). </p>

                <p>After 2 years of preparatory class, I joined ENSEEIHT in Toulouse to work in the field of informatics.
                    It is at ENSEEIHT where I joined the association of Photo7 and I was involved in my first work as a 
                    volunteer at the event of "Capiole du Libre". After this event, I was also volunteer during 2 days for 
                    the event Women7 for the association Photo7. </p>

                <p>In 2023 I had the opportunity to do a trip in Japan for 7 weeks. 
                    This was composed of 3 weeks of language trip and 4 weeks of internship in a hotel.
                    For my second year at ENSEEIHT I specialised my studies on software. 
                    I was again a volunteer for the edition 2023 of the event "Capitole du Libre" for the association Photo7.</p>

                <h2>Capitole du Libre (as a volunteer)</h2>
                <p>
                    The “Capitole du Libre” is an event that occurred the 18th and 19th of November at ENSEEIHT in Toulouse. 
        This event is dedicated to free software through conferences and workshops. Many associations of ENSEEIHT including Photo7 was chosen to cover the event. <br/><br/>

        As a member of Photo7 I was happy to cover this event. My job was to take pictures of speakers during their conferences. 
        The main instruction was to take pictures which could be used as profile pictures. 
        All new members of Photo7 were accompanied by an older member to get advice. 
        All members know what he had to do thanks to a precise schedule set up by the president (of Photo7). <br/><br/>
        This event allowed me to be more skillful with the camera and its adjustments. 
        After the event, our job was not finished. The photos had to be edited (to modify the exposure, the color, …) before delivering them.
        This was very enjoyable, all the volunteers were students of ENSEEIHT and the speakers were very passionate by their subjects.

                <h2>Women7 (as a volunteer)</h2>
                <p>
                    Women7 is an event that occurred at ENSEEIHT and the Cité de l’espace (Space city) for 2 days. 
        It is organized by people of ENSEEIHT (students, administration, …). 
        This event aims to draw the attention of the role of women in the field of engineering. 
        This gathers girls of around 14 years old to meet and discuss about the role of women in the field of engineering. <br/><br/>
        The first day takes place at ENSEEIHT and the second at the Cité de l’espace (Space city) where the girls can listen to conferences.
        This was my second work as a volunteer and it was a pleasure! I had the chance to be sectioned by the new president of Photo7 to cover the 2 days.<br/><br/> 
        The first day I had to cover few hours during the discussion between the girls and some people from engineering companies or research laboratory at ENSEEIHT.<br/><br/> 
        The second day I covered the whole day at the Cite de l’espace (Space city) during conferences and exhibition.
        I appreciate the president of Photo7 of choosing me to cover the 2 days of Women7 and to edit my own photos.
