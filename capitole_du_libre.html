        The “Capitole du Libre” is an event that occurred the 18th and 19th of November at ENSEEIHT in Toulouse. 
        This event is dedicated to free software through conferences and workshops. Many associations of ENSEEIHT including Photo7 was chosen to cover the event. <br/><br/>

        As a member of Photo7 I was happy to cover this event. My job was to take pictures of speakers during their conferences. 
        The main instruction was to take pictures which could be used as profile pictures. 
        All new members of Photo7 were accompanied by an older member to get advice. 
        All members know what he had to do thanks to a precise schedule set up by the president (of Photo7). <br/><br/>
        This event allowed me to be more skillful with the camera and its adjustments. 
        After the event, our job was not finished. The photos had to be edited (to modify the exposure, the color, …) before delivering them.
        This was very enjoyable, all the volunteers were students of ENSEEIHT and the speakers were very passionate by their subjects.
